# Using SCHC_Gateway.cpp


This project is an implememntation of the SCHC Gateway based in the standards defined in [RFC 8724](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8724.html), [RFC 9011](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9011.html), and [RFC 9441](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9441.html). The implementation of the SCHC gateway is over Ubuntu Linux 24.04 in WSL.
**SCHC_Gateway.cpp** works with the LoRaWAN network of The Things Stacks through the MQTT protocol. You can learn more about the The Things Stacks platform [here](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/getting-started/).
